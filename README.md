# Master’s Thesis: Lobbying and Language in EU Tech Regulation

This repository contains the materials for my Master’s thesis:
**“Lobbying and Language in EU Tech Regulation: A Comparative Analysis of the GDPR, DMA, and AI Act”**
submitted in 2025 as part of the **Master in Computational Social Science** at **Universidad Carlos III de Madrid**.

The thesis investigates how corporate lobbying influences the linguistic framing of major EU digital regulations. By applying computational text analysis and statistical modeling, the study compares the **GDPR**, **DMA**, and **AI Act**, developed under varying lobbying intensities.

---

## Research Questions

* How does lobbying intensity shape regulatory language in EU digital laws?
* Do periods of high lobbying correlate with more corporate-friendly wording?
* What policy domains (e.g., risk management, competition) are most linguistically flexible to influence?
* Can computational text-as-data methods reliably detect patterns of lobbying influence?

---

## What This Research Is About

* **Methods**: Lexical scoring, topic modeling (LDA), ANOVA, regression, and bootstrapping.
* **Data**: Texts of GDPR, DMA, AI Act (publicly available EU legislation).
* **Framing**: Corporate-friendly vs. public-interest orientations.
* **Contribution**: Shows how lobbying shapes language selectively, especially in risk-management provisions of the AI Act.

## Key Findings

| Regulation | Lobbying Intensity | Corporate-Friendliness |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| GDPR       | Medium (2012–2016) | 28.3%                  |
| DMA        | High (2018–2022)   | 21.6%                  |
| AI Act     | Peak (2021–2024)   | 44.3%                  |

* The **AI Act** shows significantly higher corporate-friendly language than GDPR or DMA (*ANOVA p = 0.007, η² = 0.171*).
* **DMA** remains less corporate-friendly despite intense lobbying, due to its prohibition-centered legal framework.
* Influence concentrates in **technical provisions**, where flexibility can be justified.

---

## Limitations

* Analysis limited to regulatory text, not amendments or enforcement guidelines.
* Lobbying disclosures vary in completeness across years.
* Lexical approach cannot fully capture context or subtle semantic framing.

---

## Future Directions

* Extend to **Digital Services Act (DSA)** and subsequent AI governance reforms.
* Apply **transformer-based NLP models** for deeper semantic analysis.
* Compare **EU vs. US regulatory language** in tech law.
